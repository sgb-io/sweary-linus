# Java

A very simple Java implementation using a single class. Requires Java SE 8.

## Compile me

Open the project with Netbeans and run/build as you would any normal Java project.

## Run me

Compile (clean & build) via Netbeans, then from this directory, run:

  - `java -jar dist/Insults.jar ../insults.txt ../stopwords.txt`
