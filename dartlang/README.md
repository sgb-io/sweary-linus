# Dart

## Requirements

Dart 2 SDK via https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk#install (dev channel is required for v2 at time of writing)

Note: if you already installed Dart 1.x via homebrew, use `brew upgrade dart --devel`.

## Run me

e.g. from this dir:

`dart main.dart ../insults.txt ../stopwords.txt`

## Run my tests

`dart test.dart`
