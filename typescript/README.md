# TypeScript 2.9.1

This is a re-implementation of the basic functional JavaScript implementation, with TypeScript goodness added.

## Run it

`node dist/swearylinus.run.js`

## Compile it

1. Have TypeScript installed with tsc available.
2. `npm install`
3. From the root, run `tsc`. It should read the `tsconfig.json` and output JavaScript to `dist`. Then run as above to get the output.
