# R

Forked from [Zoe's original implementation](https://github.com/zhaime/swearylinus)

A basic implementation, not following any particular style, patterns or conventions. Requires an R installation `3.5.x`.

Output generated with `R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"`.

You may also need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) to install the dependencies.

## Run me

1. Install dependencies:
	a. Enter an `r` shell
	b. Run `install.packages("tm", "tidyr")`
	c. Follow the steps
2. `Rscript Main.R`

## R language documentation

R seems like a quirky, poorly documented language. The 2 best resources are:

1. https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html - Definition (Language objects, control structures, meta, etc)
2. https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/fullrefman.pdf - Reference (contains all base functions etc) - a 3,620 page pdf... https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/ seems to be a html version of this
